                <p>My name is Madison McClellan. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area then attended Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. My love of computer science was sparked when I decided to take an introductory programming course at Vanderbilt. I am now in the final quarter of my graduate program in computer science here at Northwestern University. Upon graduating, I will be moving to Austin, TX to work as a software engineer at Apple.</p>
